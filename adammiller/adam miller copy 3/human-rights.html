            <p>I want to thank you for visiting my site and you can find out more about 8020365& thriV.  I am genuinely excited for your progression and getting more from life,simply put this works. Becoming a meaningful specific and not being a wondering generality is an important life changing decision. Life is fun when you are fulfilling your “Purpose”.</p>
            <p><i>How I found my Purpose. Larger then life Benefits.</i></p>
            <p>Several years ago, I found out that I had been listening to great thinkers like Earl Nightingale (live on  the radio when he was still around) while I was still only in the womb and as a young child. I am grateful to God for the many blessings and favor I have had over the years. There were always two special people that were always there helping me develop my skills. Two friends of mine took enough interest in my ability to qualify me for the secret of a “Living  Purpose”. He is the kind of man who would not accept the mediocre lifestyle. She always left clues around for me to pick up on and the strange thing is…I did. If you have not figured it out yet, the  first person is my mother Phyllis Gilmer who nurtured me in the power of Learning and was always there to support me . The second is my father Les Gilmer who allowed me to understand the power of Choice as a young  man and pushed me restlessly sometimes  far to much.  I am also grateful to my brothers Bond Gilmer and Connor Gilmer who are both masters in their own business and great fathers.</p>
            <p>One of my fondest moments in life was becoming a father to my son Adam James Gilmer whom I am wildly affectionate and also my life partner and very significant other and wife Jessica Maria Gilmer. The love and support that comes form family is as important as air and richer than rarest of jewels the finest gold and other precious metals. All of which for me make a man invincible.</p>
            <p>There have been many other mentors who shaped and helped direct my thinking and helped me with the process, most of which have some must read books and are timeless.  Many I quote from time to time in my speaking engagements and sales presentations. This is my unique way  of thanking all of them for their help along the way. A special thanks to  people like:Anthony Robbins,  Bob Proctor, Brian Tracy, Dennis Waitley, Ken Roberts, Les Brown, Mark Victor Hansen, Og Mandino, Robert Allen, Richard Koch, Jim Rohn, W. Clement Stone and Napoleon Hill to name a few, all great speakers and authors. Read and collect all of their works and share them with others. Their concepts, ideas and most importantly their encouragement, to move towards taking daily action. They all have deep seeded faith and believe in the power becoming and doing better, a new level of living if you will,  they all practice the 8020365 principle and understand the value of high payoff activity. They as a group if asked they would tell you they are “On Purpose” doing what they love to do.</p>
            <p>Business  much like your life requires decisions.  Highly successful people focus their time on important, Vital, critical items and they understand the 8020365 principal. If you had a way to focus your time and energy on the things you really wanted in life, moving closer to your objectives and your purpose – where would you be today? Would your life be in a better place? How many of you think that you have been doing this so far? Please do not think that I have not made mistakes and errors on my life path, I have, this is how we learn to play at this game. I have been of course many times. You have to play the life game and fail over and over again every day to learn what not to do and conversely what to do and stay focused on. We can all get up on the horse again after we have fallen off. Everyone can do it, even you. Yes, you can!</p>
            <p>Stay in touch and keep me informed of your progress on your journey to success. I share with you many of the secrets that have made a HUGE difference in my life. I want to encourage you to take a leap of faith and believe you can and move forward,  challenge yourself. We will have so much to talk about!</p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Adam Vincent Gilmer</p>
