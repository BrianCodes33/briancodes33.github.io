          <time>July 1, 1971</time> David Young and Egil “Bud” Krogh write a memo suggesting the formation of what would later be called the "White House Plumbers" in response to the leak of the Pentagon Papers by Daniel Ellsberg.

          <time>August 21, 1971</time> Nixon's Enemies List is started by White House aides (though Nixon himself may not have been aware of it); to "use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.

      <li>
        <div>
          <time>September 3, 1971</time> White House Plumbers" E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy et al. break into the offices of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist Lewis Fielding looking for material that might discredit Ellsberg, under the direction of John
          Ehrlichman or his staff within the White House. This was the Plumbers' first major operation.

      <li>
        <div>
          <time>1972</time> The Plumbers, at this stage assigned to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP), had become frustrated at the lack of additional assignments they were being asked to perform, and that any plans and proposals they suggested
          were being rejected by CREEP. Liddy and Hunt took their complaints to the White House - most likely to Charles Colson - and requested that the White House start putting pressure on CREEP to assign them new operations. It is likely that both
          Colson and White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman did just that, setting in train events that would lead to the Watergate break-ins a few months later. This narrative is confirmed in the famous "Cancer of the Presidency" conversation between
          Nixon and White House Counsel John Dean on March 21, 1973.

      <li>
        <div>
          <time>June 23, 1972</time> In the Oval Office, H.R. Haldeman recommends to President Nixon that they attempt to shut down the FBI investigation of the Watergate break-in, by having CIA Director Richard Helms and Deputy Director Vernon A. Walters
          tell acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray to, "Stay the hell out of this". Haldeman expects Gray will then seek and take advice from Deputy FBI Director Mark Felt, and Felt will obey direction from the White House out of ambition. Nixon agrees
          and gives the order. The conversation is recorded.
